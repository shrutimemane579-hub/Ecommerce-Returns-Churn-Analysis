E-Commerce Returns & Customer Churn Analysis | SQL + Looker Studio

This project analyzes e-commerce returns to understand revenue loss, customer churn, and return patterns across products and customer segments. The data was processed using SQL (PostgreSQL) and visualized in Looker Studio, resulting in an interactive dashboard that highlights actionable insights for business decisions.

Key Analysis Areas
1. Overall return rate and revenue loss due to returns
2. Return behavior by product category and price segment
3. Customer return patterns by age group and payment method
4. Return trends over time to identify risk escalation
5. Behavior-driven customer churn (redefined based on 90 days of purchase inactivity)


Tools & Technologies
1. SQL (PostgreSQL) – Data cleaning, aggregation, and metric calculation
2. Looker Studio – Dashboard visualization and interactive reporting
3. Kaggle E-Commerce Dataset – Public dataset for real-world transactional analysis


Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (SQL)
1. Standardize orders, returns, and customer information
2. Calculate return rates, revenue loss, and churn

Data Aggregation (SQL)
1. Query-level aggregations for product categories, price segments, and customer demographics
2. Prepare datasets for dashboard visualization

Visualization (Looker Studio)
1. Import SQL query results
2. Build interactive dashboards to track KPIs, trends, and patterns


Key Insights
1. Returns significantly contribute to revenue loss and affect repeat customer behavior
2. Certain products, price segments, and customer demographics are more prone to returns
3. Insights can guide smarter product, pricing, and retention strategies
